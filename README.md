# NLP Research Group @ IIT Palakkad

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for the Natural Language Processing (NLP) Research Group at the Indian Institute of Technology Palakkad. Our group is dedicated to advancing the frontiers of language technology, with a special focus on real-world applications and challenges.

Our primary mission is to break down language barriers by developing robust Machine Translation systems for low-resource languages. We also actively research and apply state-of-the-art techniques in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex problems.

## Core Research Areas

*   **Machine Translation (MT) for Low-Resource Languages**: Our work involves creating and fine-tuning models to improve translation quality for languages with limited data. We have experience with fine-tuning models and multi-language datasets for languages such as Khasi, Marathi, and Telugu.
*   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: We explore RAG systems to enhance the factuality and relevance of text generated by large language models, particularly in specialized domains.
*   **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: We investigate the capabilities, limitations, and applications of LLMs, from fine-tuning to building novel systems that leverage their power.

## Our Team

Our group is composed of dedicated students and researchers led by Prof. Swapnil Hingmire.
